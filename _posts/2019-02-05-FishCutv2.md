title: Caribou and Reindeer Population Cycles Are Driven by Top-Down and Bottom-Up Mechanisms Across Space and Time
excerpt: >-
    I parameterized a tri-trophic mechanistic mathematical model including caribou, lichen, and wolf predation. Using this model, I completed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms on caribou population cyclicity, using amplitude and period as indicators of influence. Results from the mechanistic model indicated that decreased food resources and increased predation pressure both drive the intensity of caribou population cycles over space and time. My research culminated in an honors thesis for the University of Washington's School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, a scientific poster which was presented at the University of Washington's Undergraduate Research Symposium, and most recently, contributed to a publication in Ecology and Evolution.

## Introduction 
While technological advances have revolutionized our ability to sequence genomes, our ability to characterize vertebrate phenomes
remains limited. Zebrafish are a powerful model for rapid-throughput biology, and ideal to understand the genetic architecture of skeletal health through 
rapid gene-to-phenome mapping. Previously, we developed software for microCT-based phenomics, FishCuT, which enables rapid (<5min/animal) profiling 
of hundreds of phenotypic measures comprised of morphological and densitometric traits at a large number of sites within the axial skeleton of adult 
zebrafish (Fig 1A) [1]. We showed that analyzing vertebral patterns conferred higher sensitivity, with similar specificity, in discriminating mutant 
populations compared to analyzing single vertebrae in isolation [1]. Here, we introduce FishCuTv2, which employs an extensible architecture that facilitates 
open-source development of new phenotypic algorithms in pursuit of truly whole-body skeletal phenomic analysis. We develop a new algorithm for 
automatic measurement of neural arch area, a measure of bone modeling in zebrafish [2], and use it to retroactively identify new gene-to-phenotype 
relationships in CRISPR-edited somatic mutants for the Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)-associated gene bmp1a. Finally, we provide early evidence of the 
utility of atlas-based methods to facilitate microCT-based phenomics in the adult craniofacial skeleton. 
METHODS: This study was conducted using ~3 month old sham control zebrafish (n=15) and CRISPR edited F0 bmp1a “crispant” zebrafish (n=15), which 
were previously shown to closely reflect the skeletal phenotypes in bmp1a germline mutants [3]. FishCuT software architecture was reorganized into a 
hierarchical structure with discrete phenotypic modules, thus allowing for addition of new modules to increase phenotypic functionality. A new module was 
established to automatically measure phenotypic characteristics of neural arch space (defined as the empty space enclosed by the neural arch and the top of 
the centrum): effective major axis length, effective minor axis length, and area. For craniofacial analysis, we used ANTs [4] and scan data to create a 
synthetic template for the adult zebrafish craniofacial skeleton. A statistical shape analysis of the craniofacial skeleton was performed using tensor-based 
morphometry [5].

## Results 
Neural arch space measurements 
exhibited a high correlation (R2=0.86) to 
measurements made by hand. In bmp1a crispants, we 
detected a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase 
in neural arch space area, which is consistent with 
the findings in [2] for bmp1a germline mutants. 
While minor axis was significantly different (Figure 
1.B), major axis was not, indicating that the 
increased area of the neural arch space is due to a 
widening of the neural arch space and not
lengthening (Figure 1.B'). For craniofacial analysis, 
we observed convergence during template building, 
with only a few iterations producing a template that 
was sufficiently detailed. The statistical shape 
analysis revealed contractions and expansions of 
individual voxels in bmp1a crispants. Morphological 
changes were characterized by focal regions of 
contraction and expansion, particularly adjacent to
the jaw and orbital regions (Figure 1.C).
DISCUSSION: In zebrafish, neural arch area 
expands throughout life due to coupled activity 
between osteoclasts on the inner surface, and 
osteoblasts on the outer surface. The increased neural 
arch area suggests increased bone modeling arising 
from loss of function of Bmp1a. The neural arch 
measurement module serves as a prototype for the 
development of new phenotypic modules that enable 
increasingly granular descriptions of whole-body, 
high-resolution microCT datasets. Because of the new software modularization, developers who wish to create new modules do not need to know the inner 
workings of FishCuTv2, but rather only the available input variables and necessary output data structures for measurement modules. This facilitates 
collaborative development, and retroactive screening of microCT data archives for new gene-to-phenotype relationships.
Due to its complex morphology and prominence of bone fusions, quantitative analysis of craniofacial structures in the adult zebrafish skeleton is 
challenging. We found that a detailed synthetic template of the WT craniofacial skeleton could be computed, and thus, may facilitate atlas-based 
segmentation and other analytical methods. In statistical shape analysis, we found significant craniofacial shape changes in bmp1a crispants that were not 
obvious by manual inspection. Craniofacial features have been suggested to stratify in OI types, and thus, these studies suggest that microCT-based
craniofacial analysis in zebrafish may aid in the study of this stratification. Taken together, these studies establish extensible software and algorithmic
methods that take a significant step towards true whole-body skeletal phenomic analysis in zebrafish and rapid-throughput gene-to-phenome mapping.

## SIGNIFICANCE/CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Zebrafish are an ideal model to understand the genetic basis of adult skeletal health through 
rapid gene-to-phenome mapping. Here, we develop software architecture and new algorithmic approaches to facilitate in-depth, whole-body skeletal 
phenotyping in zebrafish, and show how phenomics can reveal relationships relevant to the heritable skeletal disorder OI.
