title: Why Individual Responsibility Matters for Sustainability
excerpt: >-
  This is the final paper that I wrote for my Environmental Ethics course. I discuss the ethics of climate change and why making lifestyle changes on an individual basis is important for sustainability despite the inconsequentialism objection. This was an incredibly valuable class to me, as it did not tell me what to think about environmental ethics but rather introduced me to many conflicting schools of thought on this subject matter.

## Introduction
Climate change is a well-recognized threat to the wellbeing of humans and nonhumans
alike, but tackling this problem does not seem to have a clear-cut solution. Ethically speaking, it
is important for individuals to reduce their personal carbon emissions to a sustainable level to
prevent additional climate change damages. A major objection to this idea is that each individual
contributes trivially to carbon emissions, and that institutions such as corporations and
governments bear the responsibility to reduce carbon emissions. Though it is true that institutions
are responsible for emitting a majority of greenhouse gases, as beneficiaries of these corporations
and governments each individual has a responsibility to limit their usage of products that
contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Because individuals benefit from carbon emissions at
the expense of other individuals around the globe, it is ethically imperative that individuals act
for the collective wellbeing of global humanity. Consumer habits have been clearly linked to
environmental degradation, but social influences have shown the effectiveness of collective
consumer action on reducing emissions and waste. Though it is unrealistic to require every
individual to lower their carbon emissions substantially, collective action with less substantial
lifestyle changes can contribute to slowing and stopping climate change.

## Climate Change as and Ethical Issue
Though many people consider climate change to be an ethical catastrophe because of the
destruction of animal habitats and wilderness, others may not consider this as ethically
important. For that reason, we must consider the affect that climate change has on humans,
which most people can agree deserve ethical consideration.
Climate change affects people all around the world, but the people that it affects most are
the communities that are contributing the least to climate change. This is the notion of “skewed
vulnerabilities” described by Dr. Stephen Gardiner in “Ethics and Global Climate Change.”<sup>1</sup> The
people who benefit from greenhouse gas emissions are largely consumers in developed
countries. The cost of these emissions is then passed to vulnerable communities in developing
countries, who are negatively impacted by the changing climate. These communities are
vulnerable for several reasons including dependence on agriculture, lack of technology for
adapting to climate change, and geographic regions that are susceptible to climate change effects.
Passing on the damages of benefiting from consumption of products that contribute to climate
change is an ethical issue because it affects other people’s well-being, and those affected tend to
be the least responsible for these damages.
Not only does Dr. Gardiner discuss the issue of skewed vulnerabilities, but he also
discusses the intergenerational effects of current and past greenhouse gas emissions. As a whole,
we are largely aware of the fact that greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for a substantial
amount of time, contributing to global warming for hundreds of years. So, just as people in the
past have emitted large amounts of greenhouse gases which have affected the climate today,
emissions of today have consequences for future generations of people. The ethical consideration
of future generations of people who have yet to be born is unclear. However, our current
generations are seeing an increase in wildfires, hurricanes, drought, and food scarcity due to
climate change. It seems quite unfair to the current generations that these issues were brought
upon them by the irresponsible emissions of the previous generations. Therefore, we expect that
the future generations will feel similarly about our current generations if we continue to keep
polluting unsustainably. Thus, having been in the likely shoes of the future generations, we can
see how it is an ethical issue to consider the future effects of our emissions.
Having established that climate change is an ethical issue, it is imperative that individuals
do their best to remain ethical in their consumption habits and lifestyle. Because an individual’s
consumption habits and lifestyle can affect vulnerable communities around the world and future
generations of people, it is a matter of moral responsibility that individuals attempt to decrease
their environmental impact by lowering personal carbon emissions to a sustainable level.

## The Inconsequentialism Objection
A prevalent objection to the notion that it is an individual’s responsibility to alter their
lifestyle to decrease their personal carbon emissions is inconsequentialism. Inconsequentialism
in regard to climate change is the idea that a single person’s contribution to climate change is so
trivial that it is not important for individuals to alter their lifestyle to decrease carbon emissions.
This is paired with the claim that the responsibility of decreasing carbon emissions lies with
companies, politicians, governments, and other large institutions.
Martin Lukacs compares decreasing one’s individual carbon emissions to flapping towels
at a burning house or bringing a flyswatter to a gunfight.<sup>2</sup> He claims that because an individual’s
carbon emissions are so trivial compared to global climate change, it is unimportant to
emphasize the need for individuals to alter their lifestyle to be sustainable. Lukacs claims that a
more effective method to combat climate change would be to “take railways and utilities and
energy grids back into public control; regulate corporations to phase out fossil fuels; and raise
taxes to pay for massive investment in climate-ready infrastructure and renewable energy.”
Lukacs resonates with this inconsequentialism school of thought because he believes that
individuals do not have much ability to reduce carbon emissions through lifestyle changes, but
large-scale movements through government and policy could be effective at reducing emissions.
David Wallace-Wells also discusses this inconsequentialism idea, saying that “People
should try to live by their own values, about climate as with everything else, but the effects of
individual lifestyle choices are ultimately trivial compared with what politics can achieve.”<sup>3</sup>
Wallace-Wells claims that the purpose of politics is to enact more change than is possible as
individuals, and thus it is more important to rely on political and institutional action than the
focus on individual contributions to emissions.
The inconsequentialism objection is not that we should not care about emissions and
climate change, but rather that individual action is little to no effect in reducing emissions, so it
is not worth pursuing. Rather, pursuing change through political and institutional change should
be our only focus.

## Defense: Impact of Consumers on the Environment
Though I do agree with Lukacs and Wallace-Wells that pursuing political and
institutional change is likely an effective way to address global emissions, I think that the
inconsequentialism claim ignores the impact of many individuals taking collective action. Yes, it
is true that a single person’s contributions to climate change are trivial, but shifts in consumption
habits of groups of people have been shown to be effective in reducing emissions and waste. In
their study Consumerism and Environment, Orecchia and Zoppoli claim that “most
environmental degradation can be traced to the behavior of consumers either directly, through
activities like the disposal of garbage or the use of cars, or indirectly through the production
activities undertaken to satisfy them.”<sup>4</sup> Thus, we can see that, even though companies are allowed
to pollute due to irresponsible policy, the consumers are really the ones driving the pollution.
However, consumer habits have been shown to be affected by social influences on the
individual. In the Harvard Business Review’s article, the Elusive Green Consumer, the authors
discuss how consumer habits can be changed by social influences.<sup>5</sup> Among several examples,
they reported that “A major predictor of whether people will install solar panels is whether their
close-by neighbors have done so. And, in perhaps the most dramatic finding, telling university
students that other commuters were ditching their cars in favor of more-sustainable modes of
transportation (such as cycling) led them to use sustainable transport five times as often as did
those who were simply given information about alternatives.” Even though one individual
having solar panels on their roof or taking the bus likely won’t make a difference in the climate,
by doing so an individual can contribute to the social influences that lead to others adopting
similar sustainable habits. This can lead to changes in overall consumer habits, which we have
seen are directly linked to environmental degradation.
David Wallace-Wells says that “We have a tendency to wait for others to act, rather than
acting ourselves."<sup>3</sup> This is the exact reason why individual responsibility is important. By acting
in a sustainable manner, we strengthen the social influences for developing sustainable lifestyles
and lead to larger scale changes in community consumption habits. Though pursuing change
through institutional reform is important and effective, we should not dismiss the impact that
individual responsibility can have in shaping consumer habits and thus environmental impact.

## Conclusion
Climate change is surely an ethical issue, as the people benefiting from excessive
emissions pass on the damages to vulnerable communities and future generations. Many have
argued that individual responsibility is not important, as an individual’s contribution to climate
change is trivial. However, I have presented support that individual action can add to social
influences that can affect consumer habits and ultimately environmental impact.
