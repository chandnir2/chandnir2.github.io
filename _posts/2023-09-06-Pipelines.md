title: AutoML Sweep Over Pipelines
excerpt: >-
  This is a feature that I contributed to while working with the Microsoft AzureML AutoML team. My main contributions to this work include service side support for training parameters, metrics reporting, transparent usage, multi-gpu finetuning, and telemetry reporting. My work also entailed adding support for pipeline sweeping on the SDK side. I also contributed significantly to testing coverage for services and SDK.
