title: Harnessing the Power of Open-Source Models for Image Retrieval in Azure Machine Learning
excerpt: >-
  This is a study that I contributed to while working with the Microsoft AzureML AutoML team. My main contributions to this work are developing the end-to-end text-to-image retrieval example, performing pretrained and finetuning experiments for the models using in the text-to-image section, and adding support for the CLIP embeddings models to Azure Machine Learning catalog.
