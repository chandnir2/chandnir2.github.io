title: Caribou and Reindeer Population Cycles Are Driven by Top-Down and Bottom-Up Mechanisms Across Space and Time
excerpt: >-
  I parameterized a tri-trophic mechanistic mathematical model including caribou, lichen, and wolf predation. Using this model, I completed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms on caribou population cyclicity, using amplitude and period as indicators of influence. Results from the mechanistic model indicated that decreased food resources and increased predation pressure both drive the intensity of caribou population cycles over space and time. My research culminated in an honors thesis for the University of Washington's School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, a scientific poster which was presented at the University of Washington's Undergraduate Research Symposium, and most recently, contributed to a publication in Ecology and Evolution.
