title: Forage and Predator Dynamics Influence the Presence and Intensity of Caribou Population Dynamics 
excerpt: >-
  For my senior honors capstone project, I worked with Dr. T.J.Clark-Wolf and Dr. Aaron Wirsing at the University of Washington. The capstone project culminated in a thesis paper, which was submitted to the UW Department of Environmental and Forest Sciences, and earned me my departmental honors. This project explores the roles of forage availability and predation pressure on caribou population dynamics.
