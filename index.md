### Education and Experience
Hi! I'm Chandni! I graduated with a B.S. in Enivronmental Science Terrestrial Resource Management and a Minor in Quantitative Sciences from the University of Washington in 2022. Since, I have worked in non-profit, governmental, and private sectors, in roles including: Community Engagement Manager, Wildlife Technician, and Environmental Scientist. 

### Technical Interests

I am an environmental scientist interested in **population biology, quantitative sciences, and the intersection of widlife research and environmental policy**. I have conducted two seasons of field work for Boulder County Parks and Open Space, where I independently collected breeding bird and raptor data. Additional fish sampling and elk surveys were completed in collaboration with Colorado Parks and Widlife. I am excited about quantitative sciences, and strive to build upon my existing R Studio and Excel profficiency. I thoroughly enjoy discussing wildlife research and sharing stories about field experiences, and welcome anyone interested in reaching out!

### Fun Facts
When I am not working, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, camping, and cooking! I learned ballet for 13 years, and classical Indian dance for over 20 years. I especially enjoy performing Bharathanatyam for audiences across the U.S. and India.
