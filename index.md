### Education and Experience
Hello, and thank you for visiting my website! I previously graduated with my **M.S. Computer Science** degree in December 2022, and I am currently working as a Software Engineer with the **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Training team**.

### Technical Interests

I am a curious software engineer particularly interested in **Software Engineering, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Systems Engineering, and Devops/MLOps**. I pride myself on writing high quality code and debugging complex problems. I have significant experience teaching systems computer science and machine learning/deep learning courses. I'm always on the look out for opportunities to expand my expertise and contribute to meaningful engineering and teaching work, so please reach out!

### Fun Facts
When I am not studying or working, I enjoy being active and outdoors. I especially enjoy surfing, rock climbing, backpacking, and fly fishing!
