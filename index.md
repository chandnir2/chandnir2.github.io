### Education and Experience
Hi! I'm Chandni! I graduated with a B.S. in Enivronmental Science Terrestrial Resource Management and a Minor in Quantitative Sciences from the University of Washington in 2022. Since, I have worked in non-profit, governmental, and private sectors, in roles including: Community Engagement Manager, Wildlife Technician, and Environmental Scientist. 

### Technical Interests

I am a curious software engineer particularly interested in **Software Engineering, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Systems Engineering, and Devops/MLOps**. I pride myself on writing high quality code and debugging complex problems. I have significant experience teaching systems computer science and machine learning/deep learning courses. I'm always on the look out for opportunities to expand my expertise and contribute to meaningful engineering and teaching work, so please reach out!

### Fun Facts
When I am not working, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, camping, and cooking! I learned ballet for 13 years, and classical Indian dance for over 20 years. I especially enjoy performing Bharathanatyam for audiences across the U.S. and India.
